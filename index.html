      <h2>Hi World!</h2>
      <p>I'm Max. Some may know me as Wax Chug da Gwad.  Welcome to my personal website, where I'll be experimenting with web programming, hosting my projects, and rambling about my interests.</p>

	<p>Hmm. So I thought I'd write something really quick before school started and talk a bit about my summer. I haven't touched this website in a while due to other things taking up my time. Namely, my Blizzard internship took up my most of my attention over the summer. It was a really great experience working there. They take care of their interns probably a little too well, haha. It was a struggle at first picking up new tools and frameworks, but I had a lot of support from my department and mentor, so things smoothed out over time.</p>

	<p>Working in general took some getting used to. I have pretty weird sleeping patterns, so setting myself on a consistent schedule took a bit of work. It was difficult to fit in any extra things I wanted to do because I had so little time each night to work on things. If I wasn't working at Blizzard, I was probably working in my osu! club, managing games for our tournament each weekend or typing up tournament info and results during the weekdays.</p>

	<p>On the side of that, I was/am working on making a beatmap for the club during this time as well. I was responsible for managing the team in its entirety, organizing meetings and checkins; and I also worked on the artistic side of the beatmap, making the background, programming the storyboard, and designing a skin for it. We still need a few weeks for our parts to trickle together, but I'm proud of how much we've done so far on a pretty ambitious project. Thanks everyone.</p>

	<p>Recently, I held a game jam at my house with a few friends. And I also was/am working on graduate school applications and trying to apply to a few places for internships next year. Hmm. I'm actually doing a lot of things right now with no time to relax, so things have been pretty exhausting for me. School's starting too so I need to prep the club for the quarter.</p>

	<p>Anyways, that's it for now I suppose. Have other things to get to right now.</p>
