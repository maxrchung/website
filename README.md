Way back in the day this was my personal website, simple HTML/CSS files served by NGINX on a DigitalOcean droplet. Not a trivial first time project and something I learned a lot from. Since then my website's gone through a number of rebuilds:

- Ruby on Rails: https://github.com/maxrchung/maxrchung_rails
- React and Next.js: https://github.com/maxrchung/maxrchung-next
