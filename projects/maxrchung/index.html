      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>This is my personal site. I'll be updating a blog occasionally with posts relating to my hobbies and personal life. Posts will typically range from actual experiences and stories to gaming, anime, or vocaloid related content. I'll dedicate a section of this site to past projects I've been on and the current projects I'm working on. These descriptions here will probably be quite lengthy and bloated since I'll spill everything I can think of for each project. The project section will act as a nostalgic track record of what I've worked on. Finally, I'll reserve an about section to talk about myself and ways of contact.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This project began this specific September due to a variety of circumstances. Usually, I'd take summer classes to keep myself busy with school, but I wanted to take a short break from school and just relax a bit. I was pretty burnt out from spring quarter from taking four pretty tough classes. I did fine in them... but not as well as I would have liked. I wasn't able to explore my classes and subjects as deeply as I would have liked, so I only have a superficial understanding of what I learned that quarter.</p>

      <p>With that being my motivation, I decided I'd only take classes for the first half of summer and head back home for the second half. I wasn't going to plan on just sitting in my bed and stare at the ceiling all day though. I say "relaxing," but I just wanted some time on my own to explore, learn, and try things on my own. One of the things I planned for this latter half was a local game jam with some friends, to make <a href="../katanashoujo"><em>Katana Shoujo</em></a>. In my head it was a fun but intensive way to catch up with friends I haven't seen in a while, and I think for the most part, it was. I also needed to finish up <a href="../tatamigalaxies"><em>Tatami Galaxies</em></a> by the end of summer, of which I started previously. I was also enrolled in a <a href="http://2d.cgmasteracademy.com/">CGMA</a> drawing class.</p>

      <p>Originally I planned to just do these couple events. I got back around the very end of July and the start of August and was busy working on <em>Tatami Galaxies</em> and doing a little prep for <em>Katana Shoujo</em>. <em>Katana Shoujo</em> then took place over a weekend in mid August, and I went back to work on <em>Tatami</em> right after. I wanted to release a public beta of <em>Tatami</em> by the start of September because one of the developers, Handerson, was leaving for vacation for most of September. After grinding in a lot of hours of work, we did release it successfully, and after feedback, have fixed what we've perceived are almost all of the bugs and addressed some of the design and performance issues.</p>

      <p>Once Handerson left, I think everyone was pretty much done with the game. There are probably some lingering problems that I can still look at, but I think it's safe to say it's a complete enough game that's satisfiable for release. This was roughly a week into September now, so I still have a good two to three weeks to do whatever I'd still like. I had my drawing class to work on, but I didn't really have the motivation to spend time and keep drawing everyday. There's always anime, but just sitting there consuming passive entertainment all day just made me feel a sick and sore, physically and mentally.</p>
      
      <p>I decided to start learning HTML/CSS to make a site, seeing how I had plenty of time left. Now was a perfect opportunity to get working on a site too, seeing how internships are just around the corner, and a site would be great not only for my résumé but for hosting the résumé. I did a little bit of web programming for one of my classes, but it was extremely hacky and superficial and by the end of it I probably knew less than I started off with.</p> 

      <p>I restarted from scratch, taking it slow and building a foundation for myself. I'm usually one to struggle through tutorials and such, for mostly motivation issues, but I somehow completed the basic HTML/CSS interactive tutorials from <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>. I actually don't think I took away too much out of it in retrospect, but it was a look in the right direction I suppose.</p>

      <p>Coding for the project has been a bit odd. This is my first personally individual project. I started from complete scratch and used only HTML/CSS to make it as of now. I've learned quite a lot in the process, and I'd say most of my knowledge of the two comes from just endless adjustments and small fixes to try and achieve an effect I want. I'm more of a "do" things person than a "learn" kind a guy.</p>

      <p>In the future I'll learn more indepth JavaScript and jQuery to possibly add a bit of more flair to the site, and possibly some PHP to give some more interactability to the blog. As a side note, I also repicked up Emacs to write this, of which I used previously for a class but never touched again. It feels really nice typing again so smoothly like this. I feel like I definitely type a lot faster, and speed will only improve even further when I get more natural with Emacs commands. Why Emacs over Vim? I think for obvious reasons.</p>

      <p>Design-wise, as you can see this is a really simple and minimalistic. White can perhaps be a bit too harsh on the eyes, but it, paired with black, just seems to me the most natural combination for text. I prefer sans serif over serif, even for reading text, mostly because I can just use one font for all labels, titles, and text to save a bit of hassle. I have a plain outline theme for separation and selection purposes.</p>

      <p>Other than that, the only guiding principle I have is to try and force everything vertical rather than stretch horizontal. This is driven by the fact that I just utterly hate reading long paragraphs and sentences that stretch across the screen. I think also it'll be much easier to handle vertically on tablets and phones.</p>

      <p>After some screwing around and fiddling around, the HTML and CSS side of things seem definitely manageable. After working on this side for a few days now, the much more pressing difficulties lie in actually writing the content of the website and setting up the server/domain for this. I would say that HTML/CSS probably make up just 33% of the work I've spent already, and it's only going to decrease now that I'm getting more and more familiar using it.</p>

      <p>There's a ton of content to write about. Particularly, I want to write an indepth section on each project I've been on, and that has definitely been quite a challenge. Just working on the <em>Tatami Galaxies</em> section has taken up huge chunks of my time, and its section has grown super, super lengthy as a result. I imagine the future projects to be much shorter, but nevertheless, the full projects section will take time to complete.</p>

      <p>Setting up a server has been a major pain for me too. I first tried setting up a Python SimpleHTTPServer off my home network, but even through investigating some port forward issues and messing a bit with the router, it seemed like my home network just rejects all incoming traffic. So I turned my options instead to online hosting, and tried to find somewhere/someone to host my website.</p>

      <p>My first look and eventual provider was <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. I wouldn't say anyone necessarily recommended it directly to me, but I believe we used it for a time to host the site for SmoketreeStudios back in <a href="../slicensetodye">SLicense to Dye</a>. If I recall correctly, we swiched providers from one host to DigitalOcean, and DigitalOcean proved much more capable and reliable than our previous one, which I don't remember the name of. I'm currently using the cheapest option, something like $5 a month, since I don't foresee any crazy traffic for a simple personal website of mine.</p>
 
      <p>Setting the server up, I was really lost at first since I've had no experience with a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> before. Neither was I experienced with Ubuntu/Linux/Apache/PuTTY/etc., basically everything. It was very fortunate that I was able to follow a provided <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-launch-your-site-on-a-new-ubuntu-12-04-server-with-lamp-sftp-and-dns">setup guide</a> from DigitalOcean to help me. With the knowledge behind me, doing this all again will definitely be easier, but I'm still unfamiliar with the intricacies of many of the server parts. With time and exploration, I'll hopefully gain more experience.</p>

      <p>For domains, I went to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> since that seemed the most popular choice around. I want to say we used it for SmoketreeStudios, and a couple of people I know personally also use it for their own sites. I actually ran into a problem where GoDaddy wouldn't verify my email for some reason, and I ended up getting in contact actually very quickly with both their chat and phone support, who nicely explained to me that there was an issue with the system at the moment. In about half a day's time, I finally received it and was able to get the domain working and hooked it up with my server.</p>

      <p>A few of you guys may be wondering why I'm using maxrchung.com over maxchung.com, which I assume to still be free. After all, I usually don't go by my middle name, and not a lot of people know that my middle name is Robert, given how simple Max and Chung already are. The reason I'm using maxrchung is because someone took maxchung@gmail.com already, so my second best choice was maxrchung@gmail.com. That unfortunately set off the trend of adding R's everywhere. I am a little bit annoyed, but in retrospect, it's a trade-off I can easily live with.</p>

      <p>I spent some time trying to figure out .htaccess. I eventually opted out of using it because I did some quirky things to get around it. I wanted to avoid .html's everywhere, so instead I have directories with index.html within them. By linking to the directory, the website automatically redirects to the index.html inside. Personally, this isn't 100% what I want. I want to remove the trailing slash that results from this, but I'll find a solution for this later. These changes required some rewriting of HTML code, but nothing too drastic.</p>

      <p>I think this is a good foundation for now. The site is up and running, and I'm making various changes to it daily. Now it's an incremental process of adding to projects and fleshing it out with more content.</p>
