      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>ARIA The FOOTBALL is a game that fuses the series Aria together with Rocket League. Two companies, Aria and Himeya, row gondolas and hit President Aria into the opponent's goal. The game was made in Unity and supports 1v1 and 2v2.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Quick background because I'm pretty busy right now! This idea started off as the Aria series was to have a few new OVAs released for a 10 year anniversary celebration. I'm a huge fan of the anime, which I rank among my favorites and top of all time. It's not something I would recommend to everyone; by today's standards the art and animation's pretty. The story is all just fluff too, nothing serious or too dramatic.</p>
      
      <p>But for one reason or another I just ended up liking the series a lot. The music soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and the incredibly peaceful, warming nature of the show really connected with me. It's probably the only slice-of-life I've been able to relate deeply with and cherish dearly.</p>

      <p>Well anyways, the idea was that I would be working with some specific local friends of mine that have seen and like the show, and we'd do something right before the first OVA release, end of September, and right before school starts. Things ended up not turning out as planned. Because I was busy with my internship, I struggled to get people together, so the team that ended up working on it had little idea what Aria was about, and we only had 3 to 4 people working on it.</p>

      <p>We started off on a rocky foot because we couldn't decide how to make a game based on calmly rowing boats. The first day was spent just laying down the framework for the game. It wasn't until day 2 that we decided to throw sense halfway out the window and decide on Rocket League. Compared to all our other options, a Rocket League clone seemed the most doable and straightforward.</p>

      <p>Like Rocket League, we had some pretty wonky physics, except instead of fast moving cars we have drifting boats. Setting up goals and scoring seemed easy enough. And we could spend the rest of our time on polish. This seemed a lot easier than our runner up idea: boat racing, which would require a lot more time designing a track(s) and adding additional variables to make the race more interesting. Since we were few in numbers already, we chose the former.</p>

      <p>I had a lot of fun working on the game. This group was entirely different from the usual rowdy bunch that comes over, but I like working with different people. This time I focused almost exclusively on art. Pixel art is something I'm not great at, so I spent a lot of time tediously working over three days. After the jam was over, I also polished it up myself, fixing a few things here or there and adding in music.</p>
