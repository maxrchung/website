      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="20">"Caramel Heaven" - Last Note. ft. Amatsuki</a></h2>
      <p>20 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>This is an alright cover of the most recent Last Note. song that came out. I'm not a huge, huge fan of Last Note. or this song, as just in general I'm not a fan of the rather distinct synth sounds from the likes similar to kemu. The guitar and bass to this song are pretty catchy though. Amatsuki is also pretty hit or miss for me. Off the top of my head, the only song I can really remember him by is supercell's "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari." Regardless, this song'll probably sustain me for a good couple of days I suppose, and it's very reminiscent of the (probably) only other Last Note. song I like, "Ren'Ai Yuusha."</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="14">"Welcome to Ironic Satisfaction!"</a></h2>
      <p>14 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>This is an old, probably 3~ year old story I wrote a while back. I wouldn't consider myself a great writer as I don't really write in my free time, but because I had a pretty interesting and short idea, I decided to write this story. And let's be honest here, this probably the best literature I've ever produced. Anyways, for a variety of reasons, I recently somehow by some divine intervention stumbled back upon it. After doing a couple quick and dirty edits, here it is again. Warning: somewhat NSFW.</p>

      <p>"Welcome to Ironic Satisfaction!" by Max Robert Chung</p> 

      <p>My fingers weave through the strands of her blonde hair. Her breath is hot and moist against my chest. She heaves and moans in ecstasy, slowly crawling her body forward and pushing the puffy bed sheets aside. My hand sifts around her craned neck, rounding its way down her bare back, massaging into her shiny skin. I grope for her sprawled cheeks and legs, feeling and grabbing for her flesh. She coils her way to my face, her oiled chest slithering over my bare skin. We gaze and touch each other, my mesmerized eyes staring into her bright, shiny globes, my warm, alerted body heating her cool, slender figure. I dart forward, inching my kiss to her perked lips, eager to embrace and consume her. Let me come. Let me come.</p>

      <p>She stops my half-gaping mouth with a finger.</p>

      <p>"A hundred," she says with a smirk of the lips and a wink of an eye, and I respond immediately, holding up a silver coin.</p>
      
      <p>She opens her jaw wide, a layer of gleaming liquid reflecting off her tongue.</p>

      <p>And I drop the disc down her throat.</p>

      <p>It slides down a metal slot, passing a clanging clink here or there before landing with a thud, on a pile of coins.</p>

      <p>Then it resumes, the greasy oil of its mouth pooling over my face as it presses a cold, metallic cheek to my forehead. Its tongue traces a sickly trail as it snakes across my face, lips planting a rough kiss on my temple. With a jagged turn, it twists to the side, the robotic lights in the ovals of its eyes flashing at my shaky stare. Its torso shifts upward, the hard, chilling flesh slicking across my tense body. I freeze in shock, peering at the hulking monstrosity in front of me. Its mechanical chest arches to the air, displaying its shining, metallic figure in full confidence. Wiry, straw strands of hair swirl around in a crackled mess, spilling over its perfectly chiseled, perfectly proportioned female body.</p>

      <p>In cold sweat, I throw the object off me, heaving with gaping breaths as I grab its hair in an unconscious daze. I slam the body into the opposing wall, the metal clanking to a clashing mess, breaking into a pile of twisted, disjointed parts. I stand back panting, gaping open-eyed at the scrap before me, its shrill, fake smile still illuminated by the sporadic blinks of its damaged eyes.</p>

      <p>In a frenzy, I throw my shirt on backwards, yank on my unlaced boots, fling my coat over my shoulder, and bolt out the creaky door, looking for the exit.</p>

      <p>"Sir, sir! Is everything al-" a man's voice bellows somewhere behind me.</p>

      <p>I simply keep forward, still recoiling from shock and terror.</p>
      
      <p>I run out the exit door, a bell to my back ringing with ridicule to my departure. Step and trudge, I rush down the squares of the cracked sidewalk, not daring to pause until I found myself a good block or two from the ordeal.</p>

      <p>Then I glance back, seeing for a split second the neon “Welcome to Ironic Satisfaction!” sign before I twitch my head back forward and continuing my brisk pace.</p>

      <p>I never should have come.</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="4">"シンクロサイクロトロン・スピリチュアライザー。" - 砂粒 ft. nkz</a></h2>
      <p>4 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>New songs/coverer/producer I found today. Kano uploaded a cover of one of 砂粒's more recent songs, which was okay. I looked through some of his stuff, browsed through his Soundcloud and found this song that I really like. I'm also making this post to test out Soundcloud and NicoNicoDouga embed players.</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="2">"オノマトペメガ" - sasanomaly(nekobolo)</a></h2>
      <p>2 Oct. 2014</p>
      <p>This song just released today, and I like it very much. I've been following nekobolo (now known as sasanomaly) for some time now and love his body of work. I love his... kind of unique style that he seems to carry with him. I must admit though, I'm a bigger fan of his older music, and I do prefer his Miku over his own self covers, but nevertheless, a new nekobolo song is a new nekobolo song. </p>
