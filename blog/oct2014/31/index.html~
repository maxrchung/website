      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="31">Happy Halloween Update!</a></h2>
      <p>31 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>Wassup everybody. It's about 4AM in the morning right now, but I'm still pretty wide awake after finishing some homework just now. I thought I'd write a post to wrap up my going ons right now and a quick recap of this month. I'll probably quickly ramble about a couple things before I have to do some more work.</p>

      <p>Welp, first off, happy halloween everyone. I probably won't be dressing up later today, but I'll wear a stupid hat, probably this frog guy:</p>

      <p class="caption">Oh baby, the sexy 4AM unkempt look</p>

      <p>I picked this up from Claire's from what I think is the result of some dumb joke. I actually have a lot of random hats laying around. I have a weird, pink beanie, a pikachu hat, a panda and a fluffy bear one, among some other normal beanies. I don't even know why I have this small collection. I never wear beanies because I have headphones on all day, and it feels pretty uncomfortable wearing a beanie clamped to my head/listening to some 32 kbps MP3 encoding wearing both together. I may show some more pictures of these quirky things in the future, but I don't want to dig them out.</p>

      <p>Well, in return, I guess I'll show something pretty random since I just kind of noticed it myself:</p>

      <img class="heightConstrain" src="31/wall.jpg" />
      <p class="caption"> My wall!</p>

      <p>I finally got all my left over posters from back home and have them decorated on my bedroom wall. All these were picked up from <a>Fanime</a>, an anime convention in San Jose. I haven't been back in a few years, but I'm hoping next year they'll have some sweet guests, and I'll be able to make it. I got my license over the summer--man, that's a whole other story--but anyways, I can drive myself back home now.</p>

      <p>I originally wanted to make this post because I found a new song I like:</p>
      <iframe width="650" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/174695774&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
      <p class="caption">"Tokohana" - Yanagi Nagi</p>
      
      <p>Funny history with this one. I found the song because I recently got reattached to <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">osu!</a> today... er... I guess it would be yesterday by now. Found the song while browsing the front page of their beatmaps. I used to be a super die hard Nagi/Gazelle fan back when she was in her indie/utaite days, but not much anymore these days. Man, back in the Nagi + Supercell days, holy, those were some good times. My all time favorite song by the duo is "Sayonara Memories:"</p>

      <iframe width="650" height="366" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KMcfbSodTec?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="caption">Yes, I like this song more than Kimi no Shirinai Monogatari</p>

      <p>Even I don't know how much or how long I'm still playing this song on repeat. Some say I'm still looping the song to this day. Well, after the Supercell + Nagi collaboration fell apart, I paid less and less attention to both of them over the years. Supercell/Egoist I still followed a bit. Their songs for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_Crown">Guilty Crown</a> were really good. "My Dearest" and "Everlasting Guilty Crown" and "Namae whatever-I-can't-really-remember-the-name" in particular were really, really good.</p>

      <p>But my god was Guilty Crown an absolute train wreck. Like, I don't think you understand how hyped I was before the series started. And then the series started, and it was bad, really badly awful. My super high expectations were twisted and ripped to so many pieces that I'm literally dead right now. I'm actually writing this from the dead right now because of how bad the series is.</p>

      <p>Yeah, so because supercell/Egoist were involved with the show, I basically lost faith in humanity, and I haven't been following them as much anymore. Yanagi Nagi is another story. I just don't... uh, have a lot of respect for singers, if that's the right phrase. What I mean that they can be hit or miss a lot of times because they don't self produce their own song. Usually, I like the song first before I like the vocals of it.</p>

      <p>Supercell more or less sticks to the same style because Ryo, the composer, does all the music. Nagi is pretty all over the place. Before "Tokohana," I only really like "Vidro Moyou." And I really started hating her a bit when she did complete injustice with her less than satisfying cover of school food punishment's "light prayer" on her album. sfp's song is one of my favorites of all time, and to see it have such a weak cover from Nagi just makes me sad.</p>

      <p>Welp, this is enough rambling for now I suppose. I've been busy with school work and club work, so I gotta get back to things. This was a nice end-of-October refresher for me to take a bit of time out to write about things.</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="20">"Caramel Heaven" - Last Note. ft. Amatsuki</a></h2>
      <p>20 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>This is an alright cover of the most recent Last Note. song that came out. I'm not a huge, huge fan of Last Note. or this song, as just in general I'm not a fan of the rather distinct synth sounds from the likes similar to kemu. The guitar and bass to this song are pretty catchy though. Amatsuki is also pretty hit or miss for me. Off the top of my head, the only song I can really remember him by is supercell's "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari." Regardless, this song'll probably sustain me for a good couple of days I suppose, and it's very reminiscent of the (probably) only other Last Note. song I like, "Ren'Ai Yuusha."</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="14">"Welcome to Ironic Satisfaction!"</a></h2>
      <p>14 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>This is an old, probably 3~ year old story I wrote a while back. I wouldn't consider myself a great writer as I don't really write in my free time, but because I had a pretty interesting and short idea, I decided to write this story. And let's be honest here, this probably the best literature I've ever produced. Anyways, for a variety of reasons, I recently somehow by some divine intervention stumbled back upon it. After doing a couple quick and dirty edits, here it is again. Warning: somewhat NSFW.</p>

      <p>"Welcome to Ironic Satisfaction!" by Max Robert Chung</p> 

      <p>My fingers weave through the strands of her blonde hair. Her breath is hot and moist against my chest. She heaves and moans in ecstasy, slowly crawling her body forward and pushing the puffy bed sheets aside. My hand sifts around her craned neck, rounding its way down her bare back, massaging into her shiny skin. I grope for her sprawled cheeks and legs, feeling and grabbing for her flesh. She coils her way to my face, her oiled chest slithering over my bare skin. We gaze and touch each other, my mesmerized eyes staring into her bright, shiny globes, my warm, alerted body heating her cool, slender figure. I dart forward, inching my kiss to her perked lips, eager to embrace and consume her. Let me come. Let me come.</p>

      <p>She stops my half-gaping mouth with a finger.</p>

      <p>"A hundred," she says with a smirk of the lips and a wink of an eye, and I respond immediately, holding up a silver coin.</p>
      
      <p>She opens her jaw wide, a layer of gleaming liquid reflecting off her tongue.</p>

      <p>And I drop the disc down her throat.</p>

      <p>It slides down a metal slot, passing a clanging clink here or there before landing with a thud, on a pile of coins.</p>

      <p>Then it resumes, the greasy oil of its mouth pooling over my face as it presses a cold, metallic cheek to my forehead. Its tongue traces a sickly trail as it snakes across my face, lips planting a rough kiss on my temple. With a jagged turn, it twists to the side, the robotic lights in the ovals of its eyes flashing at my shaky stare. Its torso shifts upward, the hard, chilling flesh slicking across my tense body. I freeze in shock, peering at the hulking monstrosity in front of me. Its mechanical chest arches to the air, displaying its shining, metallic figure in full confidence. Wiry, straw strands of hair swirl around in a crackled mess, spilling over its perfectly chiseled, perfectly proportioned female body.</p>

      <p>In cold sweat, I throw the object off me, heaving with gaping breaths as I grab its hair in an unconscious daze. I slam the body into the opposing wall, the metal clanking to a clashing mess, breaking into a pile of twisted, disjointed parts. I stand back panting, gaping open-eyed at the scrap before me, its shrill, fake smile still illuminated by the sporadic blinks of its damaged eyes.</p>

      <p>In a frenzy, I throw my shirt on backwards, yank on my unlaced boots, fling my coat over my shoulder, and bolt out the creaky door, looking for the exit.</p>

      <p>"Sir, sir! Is everything al-" a man's voice bellows somewhere behind me.</p>

      <p>I simply keep forward, still recoiling from shock and terror.</p>
      
      <p>I run out the exit door, a bell to my back ringing with ridicule to my departure. Step and trudge, I rush down the squares of the cracked sidewalk, not daring to pause until I found myself a good block or two from the ordeal.</p>

      <p>Then I glance back, seeing for a split second the neon “Welcome to Ironic Satisfaction!” sign before I twitch my head back forward and continuing my brisk pace.</p>

      <p>I never should have come.</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="4">"シンクロサイクロトロン・スピリチュアライザー。" - 砂粒 ft. nkz</a></h2>
      <p>4 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>New songs/coverer/producer I found today. Kano uploaded a cover of one of 砂粒's more recent songs, which was okay. I looked through some of his stuff, browsed through his Soundcloud and found this song that I really like. I'm also making this post to test out Soundcloud and NicoNicoDouga embed players.</p>

      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="2">"オノマトペメガ" - sasanomaly(nekobolo)</a></h2>
      <p>2 Oct. 2014</p>
      <p>This song just released today, and I like it very much. I've been following nekobolo (now known as sasanomaly) for some time now and love his body of work. I love his... kind of unique style that he seems to carry with him. I must admit though, I'm a bigger fan of his older music, and I do prefer his Miku over his own self covers, but nevertheless, a new nekobolo song is a new nekobolo song. </p>
