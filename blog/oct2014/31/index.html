      <h2>Happy Halloween Update!</h2>
      <p>31 Oct. 2014</p>

      <p>Wassup everybody. It's about 4AM in the morning right now, but I'm still pretty wide awake after finishing some homework just now. I thought I'd write a post to wrap up my going ons right now and a quick recap of this month. I'll probably quickly ramble about a couple things before I have to do some more work.</p>

      <p>Welp, first off, happy halloween everyone. I probably won't be dressing up later today, but I'll wear a stupid hat, probably this frog guy:</p>

      <p class="caption">Oh baby, the sexy 4AM unkempt look</p>

      <p>I picked this up from Claire's from what I think is the result of some dumb joke. I actually have a lot of random hats laying around. I have a weird, pink beanie, a pikachu hat, a panda and a fluffy bear one, among some other normal beanies. I don't even know why I have this small collection. I never wear beanies because I have headphones on all day, and it feels pretty uncomfortable wearing a beanie clamped to my head/listening to some 32 kbps MP3 encoding wearing both together. I may show some more pictures of these quirky things in the future, but I don't want to dig them out.</p>

      <p>Well, in return, I guess I'll show something pretty random since I just kind of noticed it myself:</p>

      <p>I finally got all my left over posters from back home and have them decorated on my bedroom wall. All these were picked up from <a>Fanime</a>, an anime convention in San Jose. I haven't been back in a few years, but I'm hoping next year they'll have some sweet guests, and I'll be able to make it. I got my license over the summer--man, that's a whole other story--but anyways, I can drive myself back home now.</p>

      <p>I originally wanted to make this post because I found a new song I like:</p>

      <p class="caption">"Tokohana" - Yanagi Nagi</p>
      
      <p>Funny history with this one. I found the song because I recently got reattached to <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">osu!</a> today... er... I guess it would be yesterday by now. Found the song while browsing the front page of their beatmaps. I used to be a super die hard Nagi/Gazelle fan back when she was in her indie/utaite days, but not much anymore these days. Man, back in the Nagi + Supercell days, holy, those were some good times. My all time favorite song by the duo is "Sayonara Memories:"</p>

      <p class="caption">Yes, I like this song more than Kimi no Shirinai Monogatari</p>

      <p>Even I don't know how much or how long I'm still playing this song on repeat. Some say I'm still looping the song to this day. Well, after the Supercell + Nagi collaboration fell apart, I paid less and less attention to both of them over the years. Supercell/Egoist I still followed a bit. Their songs for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_Crown">Guilty Crown</a> were really good. "My Dearest" and "Everlasting Guilty Crown" and "Namae whatever-I-can't-really-remember-the-name" in particular were really, really good.</p>

      <p>But my god was Guilty Crown an absolute train wreck. Like, I don't think you understand how hyped I was before the series started. And then the series started, and it was bad, really badly awful. My super high expectations were twisted and ripped to so many pieces that I'm literally dead right now. I'm actually writing this from the dead right now because of how bad the series is.</p>

      <p>Yeah, so because supercell/Egoist were involved with the show, I basically lost faith in humanity, and I haven't been following them as much anymore. Yanagi Nagi is another story. I just don't... uh, have a lot of respect for singers, if that's the right phrase. What I mean that they can be hit or miss a lot of times because they don't self produce their own song. Usually, I like the song first before I like the vocals of it.</p>

      <p>Supercell more or less sticks to the same style because Ryo, the composer, does all the music. Nagi is pretty all over the place. Before "Tokohana," I only really like "Vidro Moyou." And I really started hating her a bit when she did complete injustice with her less than satisfying cover of school food punishment's "light prayer" on her album. sfp's song is one of my favorites of all time, and to see it have such a weak cover from Nagi just makes me sad.</p>

      <p>Welp, this is enough rambling for now I suppose. I've been busy with school work and club work, so I gotta get back to things. This was a nice end-of-October refresher for me to take a bit of time out to write about things.</p>
