      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="30">Site Launch</a></h2>
      <p>30 Sep. 2014</p>
      <p>Originally, I wanted to write a post once the site was fully fleshed out, but unfortunately because of time and content issues, it doesn't look like this'll be possible in the near future. I wanted to write an in-depth project write-up for all the projects I've been on, but the three I've worked on so far, <a href="../../projects/maxrchung">maxrchung.com</a>, <a href="../../projects/tatamigalaxies">Tatami Galaxies</a>, and <a href="../../projects/katanashoujo">Katana Shoujo</a>, have taken up a huge chunk of my time over the past week or two, leaving little time to do much else.</p>

      <p>I like doing them. They're nostalgic and enlightening in ways, but they're just too long and time consuming. For now, in light of wanting to do more programming, I'll finish off the project write-ups at a later time. I want to be a programmer after all, not a writer. My original goal was to pursue more web programming, looking into more JavaScript/jQuery/PHP, but I think I'll give up on that too. I'm not planning on pursuing web programming. Having a functional personal site is enough for me. All I'm doing on here is hosting some projects and writing about myself.</p>

      <p>My next immediate goal is to dive into C++ again (which I've neglected for way too long) and explore network programming. I've done a bit of networking in previous classes, but very superficially and without much guidance. In the end, I don't think I got much out of the classes. I want to use my free time now to relearn it and see what I can do with it. Having played MMORPGs, MOBA, and other arena type games pretty much all my life, I've always been interested in building multiplayer systems.</p>
