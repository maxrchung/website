      <h2><a class="noDecoration" href="http://maxrchung.com/blog/jun2015/3">Spring Quarter Almost Over</a></h2>
      <p>3 Jun. 2015</p>

      <p>Wow, welcome back. A lot's happened so far, and I've been busy with a lot of things. The biggest news to date is that I've been accepted for a summer internship for Blizzard! I'm definitely excited and apprehensive at the same time. There're a lot of concepts and applications I need to brush up on for the job. I'll be busy studying up for that in the next couple weeks and then spending all the way to September at Blizzard.</p>

      <p>As for other programming news, I've updated some sections on the projects on the things I've been working on so far. I was part of this quarter's VGDC game jam, where we made <a href="http://maxrchung.com/projects/minutestomidnight/">Minutes to Midnight</a>. I've returned for a bit to work on <a href="http://maxrchung.com/projects/blueballs/">Blue Balls</a>, trying to add some more flair to it. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find much time to work on programming projects at all because I've been doing a lot of stuff related to osu! UCI.</p>

      <p>The osu! UCI <a href="http://osuuci.com/officers">officers</a> and I spent a huge amount of time improving what we could of the club. We're a lot more active on social media, branching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/osuUCI">Twitter</a> and reddit on a regular basis and centering most of our information onto our <a href="http://osuuci.com">site</a>. We started streaming on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/osuuci">Twitch</a>, broadcasting our weekly Saturday sessions.</p>

      <p>We spent time making flyers for the club and hanging them around campus. We started to pay less attention to these later on in the quarter as they kept either getting rained on or removed, but we did get a few people interested who saw them, and it's always good to get our name out there. Out of the officers, I'm the only one with some digital art/design knowledge, so I was responsible for designing and drawing them. Justin and Brad helped print and set them up around campus.</p>

      <p>We wanted to sell charms this quarter, so we collaborated with <a href="http://kunknee-art.tumblr.com/">Kunny</a> and borrowed his past art to make them. I ended up having to do a lot of work to add the "osuuci" underneath and position everything properly. Justin helped out with logistics and buying them. Things got kind of complicated when we realized we needed to buy extra clips and strings to loop the charms around something, and things got even weirder when we realized the clips didn't fit. But after some manual labor of twisting and plying, things turned out alright.</p>

      <p>Similar to last quarter, we also wanted to make beatmaps again. With everything else going on, we weren't able to spend too much time on beatmaps, but we were able to squeeze a map or two out by the end of the quarter. Different this time though, I asked my friend if he was interested in making a song for us, and he said sure. Out came <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/s/319262">"Silicon Heart"</a>. Two of us in the club then mapped the beatmap, while I provided the storyboard and, along with another artist, drew the background. I have to say storyboarding and storyboard scripting was a very interesting process, and I'm definitely excited to do more of it.</p>

      <p>The biggest thing to come out of all of this was our tournament. Around the start of May, we helped host a tournament as part of the Press Start LAN. Really, really fun and exhausting stuff. We spent weeks in preparation with rules, brackets, and maps carefully lined up. We had a smaller turnout than expected, but because we chose Swiss for the first half of our tournament, everyone got to play a lot of rounds regardless and we had a exciting, surprising tournament. Once again, thanks everyone for coming or helping. If you want to read more about its logistics, the tournament page is available <a href="http://osuuci.com/tournaments/pressstart">here</a>.</p>
