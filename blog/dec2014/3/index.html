      <h2>The Music Track Continues</h2>
      <p>3 Dec. 2014</p>

      <p>Alright, it's been a while. I never seem to be able to find time to be doing these things, and even now I should probably be doing something else, but I have a ton of music I want to log and share. This is turning out to just be a music bloglog from all the posts I've made so far haha, but it's something pretty stressfree that I like to keep track of, so I don't mind taking some time out to writing these once in a while.</p>

      <p>Anyways, I've been playing a lot of osu! now, and it looks like a few friends and I are really going to try and make this an official club by next quarter. I've found a lot of awesome songs I like from there, some from following the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Osu!_World_Cup_2014">osu! World Cup</a> that I've been getting into. Go America...! Even though we got stomped by Poland!</p>

      <p>Currently I've been playing with a group of about half a dozen peeps from UCI every Saturday for the past couple of weeks. It's been great getting some motivation to keep playing the game, getting introduced to new songs, and just having people to talk about the game with. A lot of these guys are also much better than me. Here are some of my favorite songs I've picked up recently: </p>

      <p class="caption">I've played this song like 80 times. Still suck at it, but I like it.</p>

      <p class="caption">This one I can't pass either... but it's cool</p>

      <p class="caption">Alright, if there's ever a song I probably couldn't pass, it's this one</p>

      <p>Cool songs, for sure, but way above my current level. One day... one day I'll hopefully be able to clear them. In other news, I'll dump a lot of other NicoNico and indie-ish that I found below. Jin released new covers for some of the Kagerou Project songs for the Mekakucity Actors Blu-rays/DVDs. I also found a koyori song, a Mafumafu song, and a Wotamin song that I all really like.</p>
