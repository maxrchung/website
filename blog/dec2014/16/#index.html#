      <h2>Finals Almost Over</h2>
      <p>16 Dec. 2014</p>

      <p>It's been a while, and a lot's happened. Let's start with the most recent events and go backward. Just now, I finished a final for my AI class which was... interesting. I basically don't remember the last two weeks of class or discussion because I was playing games, but that's another story. I think my test went relatively okay though. There's plenty of practice test material that our teachers gives us, so that should be enough to not make my grade sink. Let's hope I get an A in the class.</p>

      <p>I'm writing this right now because I have a few days gap until my Friday networking class final. After that, I'll be driving for about 5 to 6 hours home. I'm actually looking forward to it because I have a 90+ Space Jam song list lined up for it. There's a lot I want to do over winter break, so I don't want to waste any time getting started on things right now. I guess I should be studying, but... that can wait until tomorrow I guess.</p>

      <p>Anyways, over break, I want to do a bunch of different things. I want to work a lot on this personal site, filling in all the empty project info sections for the previous projects I've been on and fixing up bugs in said projects. I want to work a lot on Time Game/Autumn/Whatever-it's-called and Block Buddies. Namely, I definitely, definitely, DEFINITELY have to start learning Unity and getting used to it. Holy crap, sorry to my poor team that had to suffer in me being bad.</p>

      <p>I want to work on some internship applications, namely for Blizzard; this is high priority. I want to host a game jam at my house again, this time to make multiplayer Tetris with a few local friends of mine. Like always, this should be fun in a very bad way. I want to look into building a computer. And I want to make a website for osu! UCI, maybe even make a logo for it too.</p>

      <p>I probably will definitely not get through all of that done, but at least it'll keep my hands full for quite a while and won't let me get bored. If I do, well, there's always catching up on the anime of this season or osu! or drawing. Speaking about osu!, setting up the osu! organization has been going really, really well.  The organization is now officially recognized and we've requested a room for winter quarter. The officers and I have got a great 10 week plan lined up for everyone, and we're hoping to have a fun, successful quarter.</p>

      <p>Speaking now on this past week, this last week has been really, really interesting. I applied a while back to Riot's internship program. Unfortunately, I kind of screwed up a bit. I was originally going to apply for technical internships, but I missed the deadline for that, which I believe was mid-October. I usually rely on my friends in the VGDC to help keep me up to date with internships and the like, but then it hit me, all of them were pretty much graduating. Excuses aside, in the end it was just my dumb fault for missing it. After some scrambling around, I applied during the second round positions as a designer.</p>

      <p>I got a response back last week for a test, so that was pretty exciting. I'm not allowed to disclose the exact questions or answers for the test, but I'll generally say that they asked questions on more than just League. In addition to League, I answered questions from a list of other games, of which I picked Diablo III and Hearthstone. Diablo because I played through half of its normal campaign and Hearthstone well... because it was free.</p>

      <p>Naturally, this wasn't a good start, as I've only played like 1.25/3 of the games for the test, so I spent a ton of ton of time playing the other games. Hearthstone I put in probably close to 20 hours in total studying and playing the game. I got each character to level 10 and played a few rounds of arena. Very exhausting to force yourself to play games, but Hearthstone is definitely a fun enough game for me to dump my time on. Overall, it wasn't that bad of an experience, and it definitely helped me answer questions for the test.</p>

      <p>Diablo was a different story. I started playing it pretty late, starting Saturday and then to Sunday. I had to unfortunately run the machine on my potato laptop (which is partially the reason why I really want to build a computer now) going at maybe 5-15 FPS. I beat the entire game on a mix of normal/hard/expert, leaning towards the last option as everything was just too easy with mind-numbing clicking buttons. I continued my barbarian, playing some long range draven axe-throwing goodness that was pretty fun.</p>

      <p>The questions themselves took a fair amount of time to answer and then further edit. Especially since I wasn't particularly familiar with some questions (due to my lack of experience playing them), a lot of the time was spent googling, wiki-ing, etc. to get some more info. What actually helped me a lot was looking through forum posts and seeing people bicker back and forth about issues. Once in a blue moon there'll be a good point here and there that would inspire me.</p>

      <p>I actually wrote a lot more than necessary and had to cut and rearrange sections to fit the page limit (3 pages). I can't go into specifics of the questions, but they're typical of what one would expect from a designer test, e.g. look at aspect X of Y game; what do you like or dislike about it; how would you change it; etc. Nothing terribly too interesting there. The more interesting aspect is asking participants about other games, which I think was pretty neat. I suppose Riot just wants their designers to be more general, and have a broad understanding of games. Or maybe they're secretly working on other games. Who knows, I'm only speculating.</p>

      <p>I guess that pretty much wraps up my hectic week. Also, yesterday there was a 5 hour or so blackout, but that was more annoying than interesting. Other than other than that, I guess I'll leave off with some music. This is a song by whoo. A guy I follow on and off whenever I stumble upon his music. His songs are pretty "folksy" if that's the right word, and though I'm usually not a fan of the genre, I can tolerate and appreciate whoo. </p>
